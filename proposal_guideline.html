<p>When writing your proposal, you may either use hypothesis or research question. A hypothesis is an assumption that is made based on some evidence of your research. A research hypothesis is the one which will be tested during data analysis.</p>
<p>In scientific research, hypotheses are normally stated in <strong><em>NULL</em></strong> and not in Alternative hypothesis</p>
<p>A research question is a question that a study or research project aims to answer. This question often addresses an issue or a problem, which, through analysis and interpretation of data, is answered in the study’s conclusion.</p>
<p>Every specific objective, must have its own hypothesis or research question</p>

<p>A literature review is a comprehensive summary of previous research on a topic. The literature review surveys scholarly articles, books, and other sources relevant to a particular area of research. The review should enumerate, describe, summarize, objectively evaluate and clarify this previous research. It should give a theoretical base for the research and help you (the author) determine the nature of your research. The literature review acknowledges (citing) the work of previous researchers. It is assumed that by mentioning a previous work in the field of study, that the author has read, evaluated, and assimilated that work into the work at hand.</p>

<h2 data-number="2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="materials-and-methods"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Materials and Methods</h2>
<p>A research proposal should contain this section which gives details on the materials and methods proposed to be used when conducting the research. The materials are tools, raw materials, subject and/or important chemicals used in your experiments. Basically these are important details of <strong>WHAT</strong> you use in your research. The methods is <strong>HOW</strong> you conduct the research. It describe all the steps or procedures you have done in order to achieve the research objectives, including the experimental design and data analysis.</p>

<p>This is the step by step descriptions of where and how the experiment or the study will be conducted. This is the setup of your research experiment. Explain how you will design your study or experiment, how often (frequency) will data be collected and for how long you will be collecting data. This section should be described precisely and in details; it must be reproducible. If questionnaires will be used, samples of the proposed questionnaires should be presented.</p>
</section>

<h3 data-number="2.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-analysis"><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Data analysis</h3>
<p>Data analysis is a process of cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to discover useful information for decision-making. It involves statistical which analyses a set of data or a sample of data. There are two categories of statistical analysis – <strong>Descriptive statistics</strong> and <strong>Inferential statistics</strong></p>
<p>Descriptive statistics is a describes the data or gives a summary for numerical data. It shows mean and deviation for continuous data whereas percentage and frequency for categorical data.</p>
<p>Inferential Analysis analyses sample from complete data. In this type of Analysis, you can find different conclusions from the same data by selecting different samples.</p>
<p>Data analysis is the important section in a research. It include summarizing and categorizing data. It involves the interpretation of data gathered through the use of analytical and logical reasoning to determine patterns, relationships or trends.  In writing your data analysis, describe the statistics you will use to test each of your hypotheses (descriptive and inferential). The description should include the design of the analysis form, plans for processing and coding the data and the choice of the statistical method to be applied to each data.</p>
