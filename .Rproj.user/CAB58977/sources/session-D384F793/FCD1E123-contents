- Summarize key available literature and cite the most current and important previous studies that are relevant to the current research. 

- In this section, the following must be included;

  - Explain what has been done in the past research

  - Show what has not been done -- **the gap**

  - Address what are you going to do to reduce or fill the gap


## Statement of Research Problem (Max. 1 page).

- In this section deals with identification of the problem

- The section should include;

## Hypotheses/Research questions...

- A research question is a question that a study or research project aims to answer.

- This question often addresses an issue or a problem, which, through analysis and interpretation of data, is answered in the study's conclusion.

- Every specific objective, must have its own hypothesis or research question
